  extranormal_blurb: Certain abilities are limited to certain concepts and require
    a justification in the background. As such, extranormal attributes and skills
    aren't open to all characters, they are therefore set to 0D per default. You can
    only add dice  to a skill if you have dice in the respective attribute.  Extranormal
    attributes and skills are also more costly to raise after getting approved. In
    chargen, limits pertaining to normal attributes and skills do not apply, but creation
    points spent on learning these count towards the allowed attribute and skill max
    points.
