  special_abilities:
  - name: Accelerated Healing
    desc: The character gains a +1D per rank to his Physique for all natural healing
      attempts, and a Critical Failure is treated as 1, rather than having a negative
      effect on the die roll.
    cost: 3
  - name: Ambidextrous
    desc: The character is equally adept with her right or left hand. She may perform
      an action with each hand in the same round, and, though she takes the multi-action
      penalty, she receives a +1 per rank to each skill total.
    cost: 2
  - name: Animal Control
    desc: This gives the character the ability to control one particular species of
      animal, bird, or insect. The character gets a +10 bonus to her animal handling
      total for that species.
    cost: 3
  - name: Armor-Defeating Attack
    desc: When a character with natural weapons (the character’s fists, claws, teeth,
      etc.) attacks someone protected by armor, this ability negates the Armor Value,
      up to +1D per rank.
    cost: 2
  - name: Atmospheric Tolerance
    desc: The character can breathe one form of atmosphere (gas or liquid) that would
      be lethal to most other characters. A character may not have more than one rank
      in this ability, but he may have different versions for different atmospheres.
    cost: 2
  - name: Attack Resistance
    desc: 'The character is highly resistant to a certain type of attack. She gains
      +1D per rank to her damage resistance total against this type of attack. Energy
      Attacks: Resistant to blasts of heat, fire, electricity, radiation, light, cold,
      and so on, but not the ability to survive in extremes of such environments.
      Extranormal Attack: Resistant to damage from any Extranormalbased (such as Magic
      or Psionics) attack. Mental Attacks: Resistant to mental harm from any source.
      It does not provide protection against interaction attempts. Nonenchanted Weapons:
      Resistant to physical damage from nonenchanted weapons, but not from poisons,
      energy, or similar materials.'
    cost: 2
  - name: Attribute Scramble
    desc: The character can adjust an opponent’s (or a friend’s) attributes temporarily.
      She gains the scramble skill at +1 per rank in a single version of this Special
      Ability (it is a Presence skill, described only here), which she also can increase
      as a normal skill. The scrambler must pick as her focus either physical or mental
      attributes (never Extranormal, Funds, or Special Abilities). She can never do
      both, except by taking this Special Ability once for each version.
    cost: 4
  - name: Blur
    desc: The character can appear indistinct to the naked eye or nonenchanted visual
      aids (binoculars, cameras, etc.). Commonly, a character with this Special Ability
      will only be spotted out of the corner of the eye. This adds 1 to the character’s
      dodge, sneak, and hide totals, as well as +1 to all default search, tracking,
      investigation, and attack difficulties against the  character that the blurring
      character is not actively trying to defeat.  (These modifiers are per rank in
      this Special Ability.)
    cost: 3
  - name: Combat Sense
    desc: The character can sense danger. She is never surprised. Rather, she and
      her  attacker must determine initiative as normal. Even if the attacker still
      goes  before the character does, any combat modifier from the surprise is reduced  by
      2. A character may not have this ability more than once.
    cost: 3
  - name: Confusion
    desc: The character can hamper the thoughts of those he comes into physical contact
      with, at will. He gains the confuse skill at +1 per rank (it is a  Presence
      skill, described only here), which he can increase as normal.
    cost: 4
  - name: Darkness
    desc: The character can project a field of darkness around himself, adding +5
      per rank to the difficulty of any sight-based skill totals. The field extends
      in a half-sphere around the character with a radius equal to one meter per rank.
      The field can be maintained for a maximum of one minute per rank before dispersing.
    cost: 3
  - name: Elasticity
    desc: The character can stretch, elongate, and compress his body, allowing him
      to expand his height or become so narrow he can pass through keyholes, cracks,
      or any other opening he could normally see through. It takes one round or more
      to slip through small openings, depending on their depth. The character gains
      +1 per rank to contortion, dodge, or sleight of hand totals, in addition to
      disguise attempts he performs on himself.
    cost: 1
  - name: Endurance
    desc: The character has great endurance, and gains a +3D per rank to Physique
      or  stamina checks when performing taxing physical tasks (such as holding one’s
      breath underwater for a long period or running a long distance).
    cost: 1
  - name: Enhanced Sense
    desc: 'One of the character’s five senses is heightened to abnormal levels. The  bonus
      to the skill total received depends on the sense: sight is +1; hearing  is +2;
      touch, taste, and smell are +3. The bonus is per rank and applies to  all skills
      related to the sense.'
    cost: 3
  - name: Environmental Resistance
    desc: The character is resistant to extremes of heat, cold, and pressure and gains  a
      +3D per rank to Physique or stamina checks to resist ill effects from these
      environmental condition. The character is not resistant to heat or cold  attacks,
      as these come and go too quickly for the Special Ability to provide  protection.
    cost: 1
  - name: Fast Reactions
    desc: The character gains +1D per rank to his Perception when determining initiative,
      and, for up to three times during the adventure, he may receive one additional
      action for one round.
    cost: 3
  - name: Fear
    desc: The character can provoke fear in those who can see or hear him. He gains
      a  +1 per rank to all intimidation totals and combat defense difficulties  against
      those so affected. The willpower or Presence difficulty to resist a  Fear attack
      is 15.
    cost: 2
  - name: Flight
    desc: The character can fly, either by nature or by virtue of having wings. The  character’s
      flying rate equals his base Move times 2 times the number of  ranks. The flying
      skill is required to maneuver.
    cost: 6
  - name: Glider Wings
    desc: The character can fly by drifting with air currents, provided there is sufficient
      wind (gamemaster’s call). Characters with this Special Ability need the flying
      skill to control their passage. A character may not have this ability more than
      once.
    cost: 3
  - name: Hardiness
    desc: The character can take damage better than normal. She adds 1 per rank to  her
      damage resistance total against any type of damage.
    cost: 1
  - name: Hypermovement
    desc: The character is extremely fast, adding +2 meters per round per rank to
      her  base Move rate, which in turn affects all other types of movements.
    cost: 1
  - name: Immortality
    desc: The character is immortal, though she will grow older, at a decreased pace
      compared to the rest of her species. If she is reduced to zero Body Points,
      she doesn’t die. She will not go unconscious or bleed to death (as mortally
      wounded characters do), but she will not heal without psionic or magical aid
      or the Accelerated Healing Special Ability — her arms could be blown off, her
      abdomen eviscerated, or whatever. She may perform only the most minimal of physical
      actions, such as squirming, and some actions may be impossible. She may rely
      on her Reflexes for initiative purposes only.
    cost: 7
  - name: Immunity
    desc: The character is highly resistant to disease and poisons and receives a
      +1D per rank to Physique or stamina checks when determining whether he has contracted
      an illness or suffering from ingested poisons.
    cost: 1
  - name: Increased Attribute
    desc: Some strange ability (or his species) allows the character to gain +1 bonus
      per rank to all rolled totals related to that attribute. (For Physique, this
      also includes the damage resistance total and Strength Damage.) A character
      may have multiple ranks of this Special Ability, as well as multiple versions
      of it.
    cost: 2
  - name: Intangibility
    desc: The character can reduce his physical density to virtually zero for one
      minute per rank. During that time, his damage resistance score against physical
      and energy attacks is +3D per rank, but his movement rate is halved. An intangible
      character can pass through solid objects, providing they do not contain wards
      or other spells of protection designed to repel passage of this nature. He may
      not pass through energy or electrified barriers. While intangible, the character
      cannot carry any object along (including clothing), nor can he attempt any physical
      attack. It takes a full round for a character to become intangible or solid,
      during which he can do nothing else. The character must spend at least one minute
      solid before attempting intangibility again.
    cost: 5
  - name: Invisibility
    desc: The character can become transparent. This adds 1 per rank to the character's
      dodge, sneak, and hide totals, as well as +1 per rank to all default search,
      tracking, investigation, and attack difficulties against the character that
      the invisible character is not actively trying to defeat. Additionally, no character
      may take an action to “spot” the character unless the gamemaster feels there
      is sufficient provocation, such as brushing against others or removing something
      in a crowded area.
    cost: 2
  - name: Iron Will
    desc: The character is highly resistant to all interaction attempts and mental
      attacks. The character gains a +1D per rank to all willpower rolls and +2 to
      the default difficulty of any such attempts against this character.
    cost: 2
  - name: Life Drain
    desc: This ability allows the character to drain attribute pips or Body Points
      from his target. The character must choose one set of attributes to target,
      either physical (Reflexes, Coordination, Physique), mental (Knowledge, Perception,
      Presence), Wounds, or Body Points. For example, most vampires drink blood, and
      thus lower Body Points, while succubi target the soul and so weaken mental attributes.
      The player must specify in what manner the character drains these attributes
      (biting a vein, hypnosis, and so) It should involve some sort of successful
      attack result (either physical or mental).
    cost: 5
  - name: Longevity
    desc: The character lives longer than the average Human. Often, this Special Ability
      has a Flaw attached that governs what the character must do to maintain his
      life. The character should gain peripheral bonuses during game play because
      of his "longer outlook." A character may not have this ability more than once.
    cost: 3
  - name: Luck, Good
    desc: 'The character is blessed with unusually good luck. Once per adventure,
      a character with Good Luck can receive one of the following benefits just by
      asking for it: action, breakthrough, haste, or second chance. See the “Luck
      Benefits” sidebar for details on each of these options. Calling upon one’s luck
      does not count as an action.'
    cost: 2
  - name: Luck, Great
    desc: 'A character with Great Luck can call on one of the following benefits once
      per adventure per rank: action, alertness, breakthrough, haste, hero, opponent
      fails, or second chance. See the “Luck Benefits” sidebar for details on each
      of these options. Calling upon one’s luck does not count as an action.'
    cost: 3
  - name: Master of Disguise
    desc: The character has a natural talent for disguise. She gains a +5 per rank
      bonus to all disguise totals and a +1D bonus per rank to any Presence- based
      actions while in that disguise.
    cost: 3
  - name: Multiple Abilities
    desc: A character might have multiple minor abilities that are increased by a
      Special Ability. All bonuses are added to the skill or attribute total, not
      to the die code. For example, a character could have “eyestalks” that give him
      a +1 bonus to Perception or search totals that would negate surprise, the ability
      to focus his ears on particular types of noises (+1 bonus when listening for
      particular sounds), and fingers that are sensitive to subdermal motion (+1 bonus
      to lockpicking against safes with moving tumblers). All the bonuses should be
      fairly limited in their applications, pertaining to only specific uses of particular
      skills (like specializations do), but there can be several of them for each
      selection of this Special Ability. The maximum total bonus for each rank of
      this Special Ability is +4.
    cost: 1
  - name: Natural Armor
    desc: The character has plates, toughened skin, scales, or something similar.
      His own surface adds 1D per rank to his damage resistance total to physical
      (not energy or mental) attacks and contact poisons, corrosives, or similar materials.
    cost: 3
  - name: Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon
    desc: The character has some sort of natural weapon — such as claws, pincers,
      bone sword, or stinger — that adds 1D per rank to his Strength Damage when determining
      his damage with the natural weapon. The character uses brawling to attack, unless
      the weapon is something that detaches from him or (in the case of a super-scientific
      or magical weapon) exists separately. In this latter case, the character employs
      melee combat to wield it.
    cost: 2
  - name: Natural Magick
    desc: The character can use a magic spell as a natural ability. An example of
      this would be a character who can dispel magic by his nature, rather than through
      the use of a countermagic spell. The cost of the ability — and the number of
      ranks the character has in it — equals the difficulty of the spell. (See the
      “Magic” chapter for details on creating spells; the “Precalculated Spells” chapter
      has some sample spells.) The chosen spell may not be charged (that is, have
      a fixed limit to the number of times it can be cast).
    cost: 1
  - name: Natural Ranged Weapon
    desc: The character has some sort of natural ranged weapon, using missile weapons
      (for solid objects) or marksmanship (for energy, gas, or chemical projection
      or for solid projectiles in cybernetics or super-science weapons) to target
      it. Long range equals 20 times the number of ranks in this Special Ability times
      the character’s Physique, lifting, or marksmanship (as appropriate) in meters.
      The damage for physically enhanced projections is the character’s Strength Damage
      plus 1D per rank, while the damage for all other types of blasts is 3D per rank.
      The projection must have a visible effect (such as a ray that glows or bone
      spikes) and it may not do mental damage. Note that, regardless of the nature
      of the projection, there are no additional effects from this type of Special
      Ability unless an Enhancement allows otherwise.
    cost: 3
  - name: Omnivorous
    desc: The character can gain nourishment from any organic substance (though she
      is not immune to poisons). She can also chew through just about any organic
      substance with no adverse effects to her teeth or jaws. A character may not
      have this ability more than once.
    cost: 2
  - name: Paralyzing Touch
    desc: 'The character can freeze her target with the merest touch. When she makes
      a brawling attack, she may, instead of doing damage, paralyze her victim, who
      remains that way until he makes a successful Presence or willpower roll against
      the brawling skill total. He may attempt to do so once per round; the only other
      actions he may take are mental-based ones and Extranormal or Special Ability
      ones that do not require movement. Note: Characters who are heavily armored
      or covered will be harder to hit. The gamemaster needs to decide how much skin
      is exposed and adjust the attack difficulty accordingly.'
    cost: 4
  - name: Possession, Limited
    desc: The character can possess the body of a living creature or a corpse. The
      character must be within three times the rank of this Special Ability in meters
      of the target in order to possess it.
    cost: 8
  - name: Possession, Full
    desc: The character can possess the body of a living creature or a corpse. This  works
      in the same way as Limited Possession, save that the possessing character gains
      her new form’s physical attributes (Reflexes, Coordination,  Physique), retains
      her own mental attributes, and gains complete control  over the new form.
    cost: 10
  - name: Quick Study
    desc: The character has an uncanny ability to learn new skills and improve old  ones,
      limited to one attribute. He always learns new skills as if he had a teacher
      (even if he doesn’t), and he can improve skills he already knows  at a cost
      of one Character Point per rank less than normal.
    cost: 3
  - name: Sense of Direction
    desc: The character has a good sense of direction. He gains +1D per rank to  navigation
      and tracking rolls.
    cost: 2
  - name: Shapeshifting
    desc: The character can manipulate the shape, color, and overall appearance of
      her body, though mass and body compositions remain the same. The character must
      chose a specific creature to emulate, gaining one form for every three additional
      points spent on this Special Ability. At six ranks in this ability, the gamemaster
      may allow shifting among one class of creatures (such as birds or furniture)
      as long as all forms chosen for previous ranks were within the same class.
    cost: 3
  - name: Silence
    desc: The character can move in complete silence. He gains +2D per rank to all
      sneak checks and a +1D per rank when attacking from behind.
    cost: 3
  - name: Skill Bonus
    desc: Skill Bonus represents a natural talent (a character with the Charismatic
      group might be “friendly and outgoing”), a particular knack (a character  with
      the Animal Friendship group has a “way with animals”), years of  devotion to
      a profession prior to beginning adventure, or the result of an  extended life.
      The character chooses a group of three related skills in  which he gains +1
      to the skill total of any action performed with those  skills (or specializations
      of that skill). The skills need not be under the  same attribute. The character
      may or may not actually have adds in those skills, and the gamemaster must approve
      the fact that they are “related.”
    cost: 1
  - name: Skill Minimum
    desc: The character can select three related skills unaffected by any other sort
      of Special Ability and the character will always gain a minimum total of 3 times
      the number before the “D.”
    cost: 4
  - name: Uncanny Aptitude
    desc: This Special Ability is similar to the Skill Bonus Special Ability in  that
      some sort of bizarre ability gives the character added bonuses to  certain actions.
      However, instead of selecting a group of skills that the  character gains a
      bonus to, the player and the gamemaster work out  circumstances where these
      abilities come into play. For instance, a  character might gain a +1 bonus to
      all Reflexes-related skills totals  when in sunlight.
    cost: 3
  - name: Teleportation
    desc: The character can move instantly to another place up to 10 meters per rank  away.
      The character must see her destination clearly. In combat, this action  takes
      an entire round. The character may take along whatever she can carry.
    cost: 3
  - name: Transmutation
    desc: The character can alter his substance to something else, while retaining
      his form (such as a man who turns to stone). Characters with this ability  may
      only shift into one specific substance, which the player must specify  when
      his character gets the Special Ability. Generally, this substance  gives the
      character distinct advantages. The player may select up to four  points (not
      ranks) in other Special Abilities that relate to the chosen  form, per rank
      in this Special Ability. (Thus, two Transmutation ranks  means eight points
      in other Special Abilities.) Natural Armor, Hardiness, and Environmental Resistance
      are common ones.
    cost: 5
  - name: Ventriloquism
    desc: The character can throw her voice up to three meters away per rank. No skill  roll
      is required to do this, but if it is part of a trick attempt, she  receives
      a +2D bonus per rank to con and charm rolls.
    cost: 3
  - name: Water Breathing
    desc: The character can breathe water and will not drown in water. She gains +1D  per
      rank to all swimming rolls because she doesn’t need to worry about  drowning.
    cost: 2
  - name: Youthful Appearance
    desc: The character looks much younger than she actually is and receives a +1D
      per  rank to charm, con, or disguise attempts that involve posing as someone  youthful.
      In general, characters should not look more than 10 to 20 years  younger than
      they are, regardless of the number of ranks, though gamemaster  discretion and
      common sense should rule here.
    cost: 1
  specials_blurb: Special Abilities are optional and can grant benefits. The cost
