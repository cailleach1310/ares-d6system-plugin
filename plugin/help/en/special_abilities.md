# Special Abilities
Special Abilities are optional. They can grant modifiers you can use when rolling an ability. Also, special abilities cost more than advantages.
Each special ability has a cost for taking it at R1. Depending on the config of this game, additional ranks cost the same, or can be taken for 1 creation point per subsequent level.

`sheet` - Views your 'sheet'.
`abilities5` - Lists special abilities with their descriptions and costs (spammy!).

`option/add <special ability>=<rank>/<details>` - Sets a special ability with the specified rank and details.
`option/set <special ability>=<rank>` - Sets a special ability with the specified rank and the standard description.
`option/remove <special ability>` - Removes a special ability.
