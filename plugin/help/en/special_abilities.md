# Special Abilities
Special Abilities are optional. They can grant modifiers you can use when rolling an ability. Also, special abilities cost more than advantages.
Each special ability has a cost for taking it at R1. Depending on the config of this game, additional ranks cost the same, or can be taken for 1 creation point per subsequent level.

`sheet` - Your special abilities are listed in your 'sheet'.
