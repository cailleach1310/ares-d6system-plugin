# Specializations
Specializations reflect a greater familiarity in a particular area covered by a base skill.

`sheet` - Specializations are listed in your 'sheet'.

## Chargen
`spec/add <specialization>=<skill>` - Adds a specialization for the specified skill.
`raise <specialization>` - Raises a specialization by one pip. This works only after adding the specialization.
`lower <specialization>` - Lowers a specialization by one pip. Lowering to 0D removes the specialization.
`spec/remove <specialization>` - Removes the specialization.

## Roleplay
`roll <specialization>` - Rolls a specialization with its skill and the linked attribute.
`roll <specialization>+<attribute>` - You can use a different attribute for the roll.
`roll <specialization>+<modifier>` - You can use a modifier for the roll.
