# D6System - Character Points

Character Points (cp) are gained periodically to reflect what your character has been learning and/or practicing during that time. You spend them to improve your abilities and also you're able to learn new specializations of skills.

> To improve your abilities after getting approved you will need to put in a request, telling admin which ability you want to improve.

## Admin - Commands to handle ability raises
The commands below allow admin to have characters learn or raise abilities. This will happen on request basis, meaning that each cp-based raise will have to be approved by admin. Sometimes, certain raises may depend on whether the ability was used in rp, or whether there has been some rp leading up to this raise. Attributes and skills will be raised and learned through the first command listed below, whereas specializations will need the second command to be added. This is because specializations are freeform. Please note that to learn a specialization of a skill, the skill doesn't need to be on the sheet of the char. When raising attributes or skills, this will affect dependent abilities, such as specializations as well. For instance, raising 'Melee Combat' by one pip will also raise the respective specializations of that skill. 

`cp/raise <name>=<ability>` - Spends cp to raise an ability (attribute/skill/specialization) of a character.

`cp/spec <name>/<specialization>=<skill>` - Spends a character's cp to learn a new specialization of a skill.

## Admin - Raising Options

Advantages, disadvantages and special abilities can only be raised manually through the webportal chargen method. CP will have to be removed manually, using the in game command `cp/remove`.
